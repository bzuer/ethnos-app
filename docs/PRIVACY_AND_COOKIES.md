# Privacy and Cookies

Ethnos Bibliography is designed to respect your privacy. This page explains, in plain language, what information the app uses, why it uses it, and what choices you have under common EU and Brazil privacy rules (GDPR and LGPD).

## What is Used

### Language Preference
Your browser may store a language preference so the site can remember your choice. The app reads that preference to show the interface in the right language. We do not use it for tracking.

### Your Personal List
If you save works to your personal list, the list is stored only in your own browser. It includes basic details needed to display and export your saved items. It stays on your device until you clear it.

### Searches and API Requests
When you search or browse lists, your query terms and filters are sent to the API so results can be returned. These requests go through a server proxy that forwards only the path and query you asked for. It does not send your cookies, your IP address, or your browser details to the API.

## What We Do Not Collect
- No analytics or advertising trackers.
- No user accounts or profiling.
- No sessionStorage or IndexedDB.

## Server Logs
The server keeps basic runtime logs to keep the service stable. There is no custom tracking of individual users or their searches in this project. Any additional logging would only exist if added by external infrastructure.

## Your Rights and Choices
You can clear your personal list at any time from the My List page or by deleting site data in your browser. You can also change languages in your browser or by clearing your language preference. Under GDPR and LGPD, you have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data that may be linked to you. Because this app stores your list locally in your browser, you are in direct control of that data.
